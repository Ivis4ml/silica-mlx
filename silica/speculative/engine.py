"""silica.speculative.engine — I-5 DraftEngine Protocol and the NoopDraftEngine stub.

I-5 (PLAN.md §6) describes draft-token proposal for speculative decoding. The
engine is unaware of the model's internals: it receives a `RequestState` and a
window size `k`, returns up to `k` draft tokens, and is told after verification
how many were accepted.

Principle 9 stub-replacement: `NoopDraftEngine` is the P-0 baseline
(propose -> empty, commit -> no-op); `DraftTargetEngine` landed in
D-021 step 5 sub-unit (a) at v1.7.19 (commit ``58d9fd9``). The
integration point — the decode loop calling `propose` / `commit` —
is fixed from P-0; spec-off remains the byte-equal default via
`NoopDraftEngine`, and spec-on is a constructor-time choice on
`silica.engine.Engine` (no conditional branches in the main loop).
